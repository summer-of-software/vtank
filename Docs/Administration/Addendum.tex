\section{Gardener}
Gardener is VTank's map editor.  It plays an important role in VTank by providing the sole means of map creation, and uploading maps to the main server. Please refer to the main VTank documentation as a reference to the setup/configuration of Gardener.  For help on the usage of Gardener, consult its in-program help documentation.

Gardener can also be acquired from the VTank website in its binary (executable) form, for easy download/usage.

\section{Captain VTank}

Captain VTank is VTank's administrative utility.  It provides an interface for altering user privilige levels and kicking/banning unruly users. Please refer to the main VTank documentation as a reference for the setup/configuration of Captain VTank.

\section{Map Previewer}

Due to technical limitations surrounding Gardener, the VTank team produced a map previewer for testing maps locally, before uploading them to the server.  The map previewer is a separate, standalone project, that is only available as a download from the VTank website.  Its usage is relatively simple, please consult the main VTank documentation for further details on the map previewer.
