<H2>Events</H2> 
The event layer in gardener is designed to overlay the terrain and object layers in the map. Events don't show up on the map in game. They are used to determine how a map is suppose to be used in certain situations. Events are things such as spawn points, king of the hill areas, and flag capture and spawn points. When editing a map it is suggested that the user focus on the terrain and objects first, before adding events to the map.<P>

As of current there are six different event tiles to use in gardener. They are as follows:<P>
