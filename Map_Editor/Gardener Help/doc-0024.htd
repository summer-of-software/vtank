<H2>Terrain</H2> 
The terrain layer in gardener is designed as the "lowest" level in the map. Terrain makes up the general background of the map and therefore when creating a map, the user will be asked to select a terrain tile which will blanket the entire new map. When editing a map it is suggested that the user focus on terrain first before adding objects or events.<P>

As of current there are three different terrain tile sets to use with gardener. They are as follows:
<UL>
<LI> City / Urban 
<LI> Outdoors
<LI> Desolate Winter
</UL>
<P>
Terrain also has a height associated with it. Height is set by holding down the shift key and scrolling up to increase the height and down to lower the height. Gardener uses a "global height" which is located on the toolbar. When the user draws terrain, the terrain's height will be equal to whatever the global height is set to. 0 is the driveable height anything else will be undrivable.<P>

Below are a few samples of the terrain tiles usable in game.
