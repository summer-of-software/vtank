    \brief  Coordinates construction of precompiled headers.

    This file is a placeholder. The Visual Studio project is configured to generate a
    precompiled header whenever this file is compiled. This file must thus be compiled first
    so that the precompiled header is ready when the other files are compiled. The Visual
    Studio IDE takes care of this (by way of its dependency analysis).
